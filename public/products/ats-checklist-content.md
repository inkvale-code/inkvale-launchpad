## THE 30-POINT ATS OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST

### SECTION 1: FILE FORMAT & STRUCTURE (Points 1-5)

**☐ 1. Save your resume as .docx or PDF**
The two most ATS-compatible formats are .docx (Microsoft Word) and PDF. Avoid .pages, .odt, or image-based PDFs. When in doubt, .docx is the safest choice for maximum compatibility across systems.

**☐ 2. Use standard section headings**
ATS systems look for familiar headers like "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills," and "Summary." Avoid creative titles like "My Journey" or "Where I've Been" – these confuse parsing algorithms.

**☐ 3. Choose a simple, single-column layout**
Multi-column layouts, text boxes, and tables can scramble your information when parsed. Stick to a clean, top-to-bottom, single-column format for optimal ATS readability.

**☐ 4. Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)**
Fancy or decorative fonts may not render correctly in ATS systems. Stick to professional, widely-supported fonts at 10-12pt size for body text.

**☐ 5. Keep file size under 1MB**
Large files can fail to upload or parse correctly. Compress images if included, and avoid embedded graphics that bloat file size.

### SECTION 2: KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION (Points 6-10)

**☐ 6. Mirror exact phrases from the job description**
Copy and paste key requirements from the posting into your resume where truthful. If they say "project management," use "project management" – not "managed projects."

**☐ 7. Include industry-specific certifications and acronyms**
List certifications exactly as they appear in standards (PMP, CPA, AWS Certified, etc.). Include both acronym and full name when first mentioned.

**☐ 8. Add a skills section with 15-20 relevant keywords**
Create a dedicated "Skills" or "Core Competencies" section listing both hard and soft skills mentioned in the job description. This creates keyword density without stuffing.

**☐ 9. Use action verbs with measurable results**
Start bullet points with strong verbs (led, developed, increased, reduced) followed by specific achievements. Example: "Increased sales by 34% in Q2 2023."

**☐ 10. Avoid keyword stuffing**
Don't list skills you don't have or repeat the same keyword excessively. ATS algorithms can flag manipulation, and human reviewers will notice immediately.

### SECTION 3: CONTENT FORMATTING (Points 11-15)

**☐ 11. Write your contact info as plain text**
Never use headers/footers for contact information – ATS often can't parse these sections. Place name, phone, email, and LinkedIn URL at the top as standard text.

**☐ 12. Use standard bullet points (• or -)**
Avoid decorative symbols, checkmarks, or custom bullets. Stick to standard round bullets or simple dashes that all systems recognize.

**☐ 13. Format dates consistently (MM/YYYY)**
Use the same date format throughout: "01/2020 - 12/2023" or "January 2020 - December 2023." Inconsistent formatting confuses parsers.

**☐ 14. Spell out acronyms on first use**
Write "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)" before using "SEO" alone. This ensures ATS catches both the acronym and full term.

**☐ 15. Avoid images, logos, and graphics**
ATS cannot read images. Your headshot, company logos, or design elements will be ignored and may interfere with text parsing.

### SECTION 4: SECTION ORGANIZATION (Points 16-20)

**☐ 16. Lead with a strong professional summary**
Open with 3-4 sentences highlighting your years of experience, key skills, and career achievements. This gives ATS and humans immediate context.

**☐ 17. List work experience in reverse chronological order**
Most recent position first, working backward. Include company name, job title, dates, and 3-5 achievement-focused bullets per role.

**☐ 18. Include education with degree types spelled out**
Write "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science" not "BS CompSci." Include institution name, location, graduation year, and GPA if above 3.5 and recent.

**☐ 19. Create a dedicated "Certifications" section if relevant**
If you have professional certifications, give them their own section rather than burying them in education or experience.

**☐ 20. Place your skills section near the top**
Put your skills/core competencies section high on page one (after summary, before or after experience). This ensures ATS catches keywords early.

### SECTION 5: COMMON ATS MISTAKES TO AVOID (Points 21-25)

**☐ 21. Don't use headers and footers for content**
ATS typically ignores headers and footers. Keep all important information in the main body of the document.

**☐ 22. Avoid tables for layout**
While tables might look organized, they scramble content when parsed. Use spacing and formatting instead of table cells.

**☐ 23. Don't submit your resume as a scanned image PDF**
If your PDF was created by scanning a paper resume, ATS cannot read it. Always create PDFs directly from Word or design software.

**☐ 24. Skip special characters in file names**
Name your file "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf" – not "Résumé☆2024★.pdf." Special characters can cause upload errors.

**☐ 25. Don't lie or exaggerate**
While optimizing for ATS is smart, fabricating experience or skills will backfire in interviews. Only include truthful, verifiable information.

### SECTION 6: ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION (Points 26-30)

**☐ 26. Tailor your resume for each application**
Spend 15-20 minutes customizing your resume for each job, adjusting keywords and emphasis to match the specific role description.

**☐ 27. Include relevant volunteer work and side projects**
If you lack direct experience, include volunteer roles, freelance projects, or personal initiatives that demonstrate relevant skills.

**☐ 28. Use LinkedIn URL instead of full address**
Include your LinkedIn profile URL (linkedin.com/in/yourname) rather than a full mailing address to save space and boost online presence.

**☐ 29. Test your resume through ATS checkers**
Use free tools like Jobscan, Resume Worded, or SkillSyncer to test how well your resume parses before submitting.

**☐ 30. Keep it to 1-2 pages maximum**
One page for <10 years experience, two pages for senior roles. ATS can handle multiple pages, but recruiters prefer concise, relevant information.
